# Kilobolt-Tutorial 

Basic java game built using the game creation tutorial from kilobolt. All the images and original code was takes from the website. All credit goes to the tutorial's creator. I wrote the code by following the website and learned the basics of game development. The game itself is a basic side scroller with a player, 2 enemy objects, and a scrolling background object. The game only has one level.
